# üìä Amazon Sales Analysis
**Project done as part of my internship at [InnoByte Services](#)** 

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover trends, top-performing products, States and Citys. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving sales strategies, inventory, and operations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
- **Columns:** Order ID, Product Category, Size, Sales Channel, Fulfillment, fulfilled by, Customer Type (B2B/B2C), Order Status, Sales Quantity, Revenue, City, State, Order Date  
- **Business Context:** Dataset contains Amazon orders, including product details, fulfillment info, and sales performance across States and Citys.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Imported Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
   - Loaded the dataset into Jupyter Notebook  

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handled missing/null values in `amount` and `fulfilled_by` columns  
   - Renamed all column names from uppercase to lowercase for consistency  
   - Filled missing `amount` values (for non-cancelled orders) with average amount  
   - Replaced `amount` and `qty` values with 0 for cancelled orders  
   - Detected and treated outliers in the `amount` column  

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new time-based columns: `month`, `year`, and `day_name` from the order date  

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed univariate, bivariate, and time-series analysis  
   - Visualized category-wise sales, size preferences, fulfillment channels, geographic performance, and weekly trends  

6. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Exported the cleaned dataset to a CSV file  
   - Imported it into Power BI  
   - Designed an interactive Amazon Sales Analysis dashboard showcasing key KPIs and trends
